# PostfixCalculator
A program that will read postfix expression that may contain only integer numbers and operators (consider only binary operators: /, *, -, and + ) which are delimited by single or more white space. Then the program will calculate the value of the expression and print it.  
(If input postfix expression is not valid appropriate error message will be printed such as missing operand, missing operator or invalid symbol in the expression)
